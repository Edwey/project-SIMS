# University Management System - How It Works

## System Overview

The University Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform that manages all aspects of university operations including student information, course management, grades, attendance, and user authentication. Built with PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, it provides role-based access for administrators, instructors, and students.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** PHP 8+ with PDO database abstraction
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 responsive framework
- **Database:** MySQL/MariaDB with 15+ interconnected tables
- **Security:** Password hashing, session management, input sanitization

### Database Design
The system uses a normalized database structure with:
- **15+ Tables** covering users, students, courses, grades, attendance
- **Foreign key relationships** ensuring data integrity
- **Proper indexing** for optimal query performance
- **Role-based data filtering** at the database level

## User Roles & Workflows

## Authentication & Security Flow

### Login Process
```
User visits login.php → Enters credentials →
System validates against database → Password verified →
Session created with user role → Redirected to role dashboard
```

### Security Measures
- **Password Hashing:** Uses PHP's password_hash() for secure storage
- **Session Management:** 30-minute timeout with automatic logout
- **Input Sanitization:** All user input cleaned to prevent XSS
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** PDO prepared statements throughout
- **Role Validation:** Every action checked against user permissions

## Data Flow & Relationships

### Student Enrollment Process
```
1. Admin creates departments and courses
2. Student registers and selects department
3. System restricts course enrollment to student's department
4. Student enrolls in available courses
5. Enrollment record created with semester and academic year
6. Student automatically enrolled in course subjects
```

### Grade Management Process
```
1. Instructor enters grades for enrolled students
2. System calculates GPA based on grade points and credits
3. Final grades stored in enrollments table
4. Students can view grades in personal dashboard
5. Academic progress updated across all semesters
```

### Attendance Tracking Process
```
1. Instructor marks attendance for each class
2. System records attendance per course per student
3. Attendance reports generated for advisors
4. Students can view personal attendance records
5. Chronic absenteeism flagged for administrative review
```
