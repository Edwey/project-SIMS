Deployment & Remaining Tasks for University Management System

1) Prepare hosting
- Create hosting account with PHP 8.x support.
- Create MySQL database; note DB host, name, user, pass.

2) Database
- Import database/schema.sql via database management tool.
- Verify tables: users, otp_codes, password_resets, notifications, etc.

3) Upload code (to web root)
- Folders: admin, instructor, student, includes, assets, vendor (if present).
- Files: index.php (if any), login.php, mfa_verify.php, forgot_password.php, reset_password.php, logout.php, any other root PHP files.

4) Configure production
- On server, create includes/config.local.php with:
  - SITE_URL = '/'
  - DB_HOST/DB_PORT/DB_USER/DB_PASS/DB_NAME
  - APP_DEBUG = false
  - MAIL_SMTP_HOST/PORT/SECURE/USER/PASS (or plan API fallback)

5) Email delivery
- Configure SMTP settings. If SMTP fails:
  - Switch to email API over HTTPS (e.g., Brevo API) or use a trusted SMTP proxy.
  - Temporarily log emails to email_outbox table for verification.

6) Test flows
- Login + MFA (admin enforced, others optional toggle).
- MFA resend email.
- Forgot password + reset link.
- Student/Instructor profile: MFA toggle + password change.
- Admin notifications dropdown loads.

7) Hardening
- Ensure APP_DEBUG=false (prod).
- Remove any debug surface (hidden automatically when APP_DEBUG=false).
- Verify CA bundle not required on host (host-managed TLS trust). If needed, use API email.

8) Nice-to-haves
- Add course registration UI (add/drop, waitlist) and instructor grade entry.
- Student transcript and billing UI.
- Admin reports/dashboards.

Files to exclude from VCS/commit
- includes/config.local.php (create only on server)

Notes
- Set SITE_URL='/' on host (app deployed at domain root).
- If app under subfolder, set SITE_URL to '/subfolder'.
- Define role-based admin permissions (Super Admin, Registrar, Finance, Admissions) and update UI/actions to honor roles
