University Management System – Live Presentation Script

1. Opening (30–60 seconds)

Introduce yourself and the project in one sentence:
“This is a University Management System that manages the full student lifecycle from admissions to graduation, with automation around enrollment rules and post‑graduation access.”

State the main goals:
1) Reduce manual work for admins and instructors.
2) Enforce academic rules automatically (levels, prerequisites, graduation).
3) Give students a self‑service portal for their academic record.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. What the system does (high‑level)

There are three main roles:
- Admin: manages departments, programs, courses, students, enrollments, finance, and notifications.
- Instructor: manages their course sections, attendance, grades, and student enrollment into their sections.
- Student: sees a dashboard, enrolls in courses, checks grades, fees, and progress.

The system covers the full lifecycle:
1) Applicant applies and is accepted.
2) Student account is created and the student finalizes registration.
3) Student enrolls in courses, but only courses allowed for their department and level.
4) Instructors grade and finalize sections.
5) Level 400 students graduate. Their accounts stay active for a short grace period, then are locked automatically.

Key message:
Admins, instructors, and students all work in the same system, but each with their own view and permissions.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Demo flow (what to show, in order)

3.1 Admin view – overview and admissions (about 2–3 minutes)

Step 1: Login as admin.
- Show the admin dashboard (total users, students, courses, etc.).
- Mention that only admins can see this console because of role‑based access.

Step 2: Admissions pipeline.
- Open the admissions management page.
- Show filters like status: under review, offered, accepted, rejected.
- Explain how staff move applicants through these statuses.
- Mention that there is a cleanup rule that can remove old “accepted” applications after some time, so the table does not grow forever.

Step 3: Student creation and onboarding.
- Show that accepted applicants become student records.
- Mention that after this, students can log in to the student portal.

Key message:
Admins get a central console for admissions, student records, and the basic structure of the university (departments, programs, and courses).

------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Student experience – enrollment and self‑service (about 3–4 minutes)

Step 1: Login as a student and open the student dashboard.
- Point out basic profile information.
- Show current semester courses, if any.
- Show any GPA or progress summary, even if it is simple.

Step 2: Level‑based course enrollment.
- Go to the student course enrollment page.
- Explain the rule:
  Each course is tagged with a level (for example Level 100, 200, 300, 400).
  The system only allows a student to enroll in courses that match their current level.
- Demonstration:
  Try to enroll a Level 100 student into a Level 300 course and show the error message.
  Then enroll the same student into a course at their correct level and show that it succeeds.
- Mention prerequisites:
  If you have courses with prerequisites set up, show that the system checks for completed prerequisite course codes before allowing enrollment.

Step 3: Grades and fees.
- Open the student grades page.
  Show a table with courses, final grades, and credits.
- Open the fee or finance page.
  Show payment status such as Paid, Pending, or Overdue.
  Explain that admins update these records, and students can always see the latest status.

Step 4: Graduation lock information for a Level 400 student.
- Log in as a Level 400 student near graduation.
- Show a message on the dashboard indicating the graduation lock date.
  For example: “You will lose access on [date] after your graduation grace period ends.”

Key message:
Students have self‑service access, but the system enforces academic rules, especially course level eligibility and the graduation access window.

------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Instructor experience – managing students and grades (about 3–4 minutes)

Step 1: Login as an instructor.
- Show the instructor dashboard with the list of course sections and student counts.

Step 2: Instructor “Students” page.
- Open the instructor students page.
- Show the search box and start typing a student’s name, ID, or email.
- Explain how the search works:
  It focuses on students in the instructor’s department and sections.
  It can also find students who are already enrolled in the instructor’s sections.

Step 3: Section selection with clear labels.
- Point at the section dropdowns.
- Show that each option displays: course code, course name, section name, semester, and year.
- Explain that this avoids confusion when there are multiple sections of something like “IT 101”.

Step 4: Level‑aware enrollment from the instructor side.
- Pick a student from the table and open the “Enroll” dropdown.
- Explain that this dropdown is filtered to only show sections whose course level matches that student’s current level.
- Enroll the student into one of these sections and show the success message.
- Explain that underneath, the same enrollment function is used as in the student portal, so the rules are consistent.

Step 5: Grade entry and its impact.
- Open a grade entry page for one of the instructor’s sections.
- Enter some assessment scores and show that the system computes a final grade.
- Explain that when grades are finalized for a course section:
  Final grades are stored for each enrollment.
  For graduating students, the system can mark them as completed and start their graduation grace period.

Key message:
Instructors can search, invite, and enroll the right students into the right sections, and the UI helps them respect level rules and identify sections clearly.

------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 Automation and graduation handling (about 1–2 minutes)

Explain the graduation rules:
- When a Level 400 student has their final grades recorded, the system marks them as completed.
- It calculates a graduation_lock_at date (for example, two weeks after graduation).
- The student can keep logging in until that date; after that, they should lose access.

Show the automatic account locking:
- Mention the command line script that is meant to be run nightly by a scheduler.
  It finds users whose graduation_lock_at date has passed and disables their accounts.
- Explain that the login helper also checks graduation_lock_at, so blocked graduates cannot log in even if they know their password.

Explain why this matters:
- Universities usually allow a short window after graduation so students can download transcripts or sort out issues.
- After that period, IT has to deactivate accounts.
- This system models that process explicitly instead of relying on a one‑time manual cleanup.

Key message:
The system does not stop at grading. It automates post‑graduation access and cleanup.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Technical architecture (about 2–3 minutes, mostly verbal)

Technology stack:
- Backend: PHP 8+ with PDO for database access.
- Database: MySQL or MariaDB with a normalized schema and foreign keys.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and some JavaScript for interactivity.

Code structure:
- The “includes” folder contains reusable helpers, including:
  functions for database access, enrollment, admissions, finance, authentication, CSRF, flash messages, and security headers.
- The “admin”, “student”, and “instructor” folders hold the interfaces for each role.
- The “database” folder contains the main schema definition and a setup script that seeds sample data:
  It creates academic years, semesters, departments, programs, and levels.
  It inserts demo instructors, students, courses, and course sections.
  It seeds enrollments and sample grades and recalculates enrollment counts.

Business logic highlights:
- Enrollment helpers enforce:
  course capacity and waitlists,
  department and level rules,
  and prerequisites.
- Graduation helpers compute and enforce the graduation_lock_at date.
- Notification helpers send in‑app messages to users, for example when enrollment succeeds, a grade is posted, or a fee status changes.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Security and reliability (brief)

Main security measures:
- Password hashing using standard PHP functions.
- CSRF tokens on forms to prevent cross‑site request forgery.
- Session timeouts and activity refresh to avoid stale sessions.
- Prepared statements on all database queries.

Data consistency:
- Normalized tables with foreign keys and constraints.
- Aggregate counts, such as the number of students enrolled in a section, can be recomputed from the enrollments table to stay accurate.

Suggested way to explain this:
“I did not just build pages. I designed a consistent data model and security layer that enforces university rules and protects user data.”

------------------------------------------------------------
6. How to answer common grader questions

Question: What is unique about this project?
Suggested answer:
“It covers the full lifecycle from admissions to post‑graduation, and it automates important academic rules. In particular, it enforces level‑based enrollment and a graduation grace period with automatic account locking. It also gives instructors a realistic tool to manage students and enrollments with these rules built in.”

Question: How do you ensure data consistency?
Suggested answer:
“The database is normalized with foreign keys, and almost all writes go through helper functions that validate inputs. When the system shows counts, like how many students are enrolled in a section, it can recompute those counts directly from the enrollments table so the numbers stay correct.”

Question: How secure is it?
Suggested answer:
“I use password hashing, CSRF tokens, and prepared statements everywhere. Each route checks the user’s role, and sessions have timeouts, so access is controlled at multiple layers.”

Question: What would you add next?
Suggested answer:
“Next steps would be richer analytics dashboards with charts, deeper integration with real payment gateways, a mobile or progressive web app front‑end, and more automated notifications (for example, email or SMS reminders) powered by the existing notification system.”

------------------------------------------------------------
7. Closing

Suggested closing statement:

“This system does not just store student records. It models the real rules of a university: who can enroll in which courses, how graduation is handled, and how admins and instructors collaborate, while giving students a self‑service portal. The automation around levels and graduation locks is where I focused most of my effort, and it makes the implementation more realistic than a basic CRUD project.”
